# Additional ligatures for Arabic presentation forms. These ligatures are not
# mandatory in Arabic fonts, so may not be wanted in some situations, which is
# why they have been put in a separate file. However, this file is a work in 
# progress. It does not contain all the ligatures that are defined by Unicode.
# In particular, it contains only 2-character ligatures that have isolated 
# forms.

# Created by PH, August 2020
