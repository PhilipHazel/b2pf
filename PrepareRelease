# Script to prepare the files for building a B2PF release. It does some
# processing of the documentation, detrails files, and creates b2pf.h.generic
# and config.h.generic (for use by builders who can't run ./configure).

# You must run this script before runnning "make dist". If its first argument
# is "doc", it stops after preparing the documentation. There are no other
# arguments. The script makes use of the following files:

# 132html     A Perl script that converts a .1 or .3 man page into HTML. It
#             "knows" the relevant troff constructs that are used in the B2PF
#             man pages.

# CheckMan    A Perl script that checks man pages for typos in the mark up.

# Detrail     A Perl script that removes trailing spaces from files.

# doc/index.html.src
#             A file that is copied as index.html into the doc/html directory
#             when the HTML documentation is built. It works like this so that
#             doc/html can be deleted and re-created from scratch.

# README      This file is copied into the doc/html directory, with a .txt
#             extension, so that it can by hyperlinked from the HTML
#             documentation, because some people just go to the HTML without
#             looking for text files.


# First, sort out the documentation.

cd doc
echo Processing documentation

# Check the man pages

perl ../CheckMan *.1 *.3
if [ $? != 0 ] ; then exit 1; fi

# Make HTML form of the documentation.

echo "Making HTML documentation"
/bin/rm html/*
cp index.html.src html/index.html
cp ../README html/README.txt

for file in *.1 ; do
  base=`basename $file .1`
  echo "  Making $base.html"
  perl ../132html -toc $base <$file >html/$base.html
done

for file in *.3 ; do
  base=`basename $file .3`
  echo "  Making $base.html"
  perl ../132html -toc $base <$file >html/$base.html
done

# End of documentation processing; stop if only documentation required.

cd ..
echo Documentation done
if [ "$1" = "doc" ] ; then exit; fi

# These files are detrailed.
