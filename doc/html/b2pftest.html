<P>
<b>b2pftest [options] [input file [output file]]</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>b2pftest</b> is a test program for the B2PF presentation forms library. This
document describes the features of the test program; for details of the B2PF
library function calls and their options, see the
<a href="b2pf.html"><b>b2pf</b></a>
documentation.
</P>
<P>
The input for <b>b2pftest</b> is a sequence of lines, each of which is a UTF-8
string to be processed by the library. Although the input is always UTF-8, if
the <b>-16</b> or <b>-32</b> option is set, the input is converted to UTF-16 or
UTF-32, respectively, before processing, and the output from the library is
then translated back to UTF-8 before being written out. There are also command
lines for setting options and controlling some special actions.
</P>
<br><a name="SEC2" href="#TOC1">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS</a><br>
<P>
<b>-8</b>
Call the library in UTF-8 mode; this is the default.
</P>
<P>
<b>-16</b>
Call the library in UTF-16 mode.
</P>
<P>
<b>-32</b>
Call the library in UTF-32 mode.
</P>
<P>
<b>-F</b> &#60;<i>directory-list</i>&#62;
Search the given colon-separated list of directories for rules files, before
searching the default directory that was set up when B2PF was built.
</P>
<P>
<b>-help</b>
Output a brief summary these options and then exit.
</P>
<P>
<b>-q</b>
Do not output the version number of <b>b2pftest</b> at the start of execution.
</P>
<P>
<b>-version</b>
Output the B2PF version number and then exit.
</P>
<P>
Only one of <b>-8</b>, <b>-16</b>, or <b>-32</b> may be specified.
</P>
<br><a name="SEC3" href="#TOC1">DESCRIPTION</a><br>
<P>
If <b>b2pftest</b> is given two filename arguments, it reads from the first and
writes to the second. If the first name is "-", input is taken from the
standard input. If <b>b2pftest</b> is given only one argument, it reads from
that file and writes to stdout. Otherwise, it reads from stdin and writes to
stdout. When the input is a terminal, <b>b2pftest</b> prompts for each line of
input with "&#62;". Leading white space in all lines is ignored.
</P>
<P>
When <b>b2pftest</b> is built, a configuration option can specify that it
should be linked with the <b>libreadline</b> or <b>libedit</b> library. When this
is done, if the input is from a terminal, it is read using the <b>readline()</b>
function. This provides line-editing and history facilities. The output from
the <b>-help</b> option states whether or not <b>readline()</b> will be used.
</P>
<br><a name="SEC4" href="#TOC1">COMMAND LINES</a><br>
<P>
A line that begins (after optional white space) with # is interpreted as a
command line. If # is followed by a space or an exclamation mark, the line is
treated as a comment, and ignored. Otherwise, the following commands are
recognized:
<pre>
  #context_create "<i>name</i>"
</pre>
This should normally be the first non-comment input. It causes a B2PF context
to be created. This becomes the current context that is used for subsequent
calls to <b>b2pf_format_string()</b>. If these is an existing context, it is
freed before creating the new one. If the name is not an empty string, a rules
file with that name is sought in the directories specified by the <b>-F</b>
option (if given) and the default rules direcory. For example:
<pre>
  #context_create "Arabic"
</pre>
If the name is an empty string, an empty context is created.
<pre>
  #context_extend <i>rule text</i>
</pre>
This command passes the rest of the input line to the
<b>b2pf_context_extend()</b> function, which adds the information to the current
context. By starting from an empty context, all the context information can be
set up this way, without reading a rules file. Details of rules files are given
in the
<a href="b2pf.html"><b>b2pf</b></a>
documentation.
<pre>
  #input_backchars
</pre>
Pass the B2PF_INPUT_BACKCHARS option when calling <b>b2pf_format_string()</b>.
<pre>
  #input_backcodes
</pre>
Pass the B2PF_INPUT_BACKCODES option when calling <b>b2pf_format_string()</b>.
<pre>
  #output_backchars
</pre>
Pass the B2PF_OUTPUT_BACKCHARS option when calling <b>b2pf_format_string()</b>.
<pre>
  #output_backcodes
</pre>
Pass the B2PF_OUTPUT_BACKCODES option when calling <b>b2pf_format_string()</b>.
<pre>
 #reset
</pre>
Reset all the options for <b>b2pf_format_string()</b>.
