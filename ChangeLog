Change Log for B2PF
-------------------

Version 0.11 09-April-2025
--------------------------

Added a callback facility, currently only for ligatures. When enabled, B2PF
asks the application whether or not any ligature is is about to use is
acceptable. If not, the ligature is not used.


Version 0.10 23-September-2020
------------------------------

1. A ligature is now recognized even if there are combining characters between
two non-combining characters. Ligatures can be formed only from two combining
or two non-combining characters, never one of each.

2. Added 6 common Arabic diacritic ligatures to the "Arabic" rules file.

3. Added 'A' rules for ligatures that are applied after processing. These apply
only to non-combining characters.

4. Fixed some typos in Arabic rules.

5. Added checks of the ligature definitions at the start of formatting, and the
apparatus for passing back error details.


Version 0.00 06-August-2020
--------------------------

This is the first release.
